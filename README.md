### This is just a unoffical rewrite of A3Wasteland....  

#### Planned Changes / Differences  

Server / Client BPO by default  
Using A3 standard .paa images were possible  
Using extDB by default, allows some optimizing by assuming all objects etc have DB ID etc..  
Support of HC  
Dynamic Mission Sites  
SpyGlass  
Using more Arma3 Specfic code + no mf_compile function  

#### Why the need to another Wasteland mission ??  
None really, i am just bored...  
The only reason extDB exists is because Epoch + 2017 Mods for Arma3 didn't have a public release yet.  
Mission allows me to use extDB and add anything its lacking / needs, also is nice to point @ a mission system for people to look at.  


#### KOFH Support ?  
It should be doable, no idea if i ever get around to it  

#### When it be ready ?  
No idea, its still heavy WIP....  
Parts left todo is just tedious   
Might never get finished... help would be nice ;)

#### Change i add code from A3Wasteland ?  
Please note A3Wasteland changed their license to AGPL...  
Use https://github.com/Torndeco/ArmA3_Wasteland.Altis as a baseline...
That means no adding code from A3Wasteland V1 etc like that new scoreboard without permission.  
I would like to keep this repo GPLv3, makes it simplier to use other GPLv3 Code.  
Also reduces issue if Server Admins would like to keep private custom changes etc...  


#### Credits:  
Are incomplete in places etc...  
I plan to finish going through them later this week, when i get a chance.
